        <h2><b>Classification</b></h2>
        <p class="Trees-classification">Trees are classified into</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Conifers trees</li>
            <li>Broadleaf trees</li>
            <li>Deciduous trees</li>
            <li>Evergreen trees</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Conifers trees</h3>
        <p class="Conifers-trees">Conifers trees usually distinguished by tough evergreen needle-shaped or scaly leaves, called needles, or needles, form cones or juniper berries.</p>
        <h3>Broadleaf trees</h3>
        <p class="Broadleaf-trees">Broadleaf trees have wide and flat leaves, which are much less thick than the length and width, usually falling off once a year.</p>
        <h3>Deciduous trees</h3>
        <p class="Deciduous-trees">Deciduous trees have a clear change in deciduous cover: all leaves on the tree lose their green color and fall off, in winter the tree stands without leaves, in spring new leaves grow from the buds.</p>
        <h3>Evergreen trees</h3>
        <p class="Evergreen-trees">Evergreen trees don't have a clear change of deciduous cover: foliage is on the tree at any time of the year, and the change of leaves occurs gradually, throughout the life of the tree.</p>
