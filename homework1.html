        <p>The tree is a perennial plant with a solid trunk and departing from it the branches that form the crown.</p>
        <h2>Classification</h2>
        <p>Trees are classified into:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="conifers">Conifers trees</span></li>
            <li><span class="broadleaf">Broadleaf trees</span></li>
            <li><span class="deciduous">Deciduous trees</span></li>
            <li><span class="evergreen">Evergreen trees</span></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Conifers trees</h3>
        <p class="conifers">Conifers trees usually distinguished by tough evergreen needle-shaped or scaly leaves, called needles, or needles, form cones or juniper berries.</p>
        <h3>Broadleaf trees</h3>
        <p class="broadleaf">Broadleaf trees have wide and flat leaves, which are much less thick than the length and width, usually falling off once a year.</p>
        <h3>Deciduous trees</h3>
        <p class="deciduous">Deciduous trees have a clear change in deciduous cover: all leaves on the tree lose their green color and fall off, in winter the tree stands without leaves, in spring new leaves grow from the buds.</p>
        <h3>Evergreen trees</h3>
        <p class="evergreen">Evergreen trees don't have a clear change of deciduous cover: foliage is on the tree at any time of the year, and the change of leaves occurs gradually, throughout the life of the tree.</p>
